# VideoLabeler-YOLOV8.ipynb:
Uses YOLOB8 to detect objects and label them. The input file has to be a video file. The program outputs two files:
1. A video file marking labeled bounding boxes of objects. The name of the output video file is "inout video file name"+"_out.avi"
2. A text file in which each line contains the detected object names in a frame. The name of the output text file is "inout video file name"+"_out.txt"

# YOLO V8 model files:
The original YOLO V8 model files are available here: https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/#models
